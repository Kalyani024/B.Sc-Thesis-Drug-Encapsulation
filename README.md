# B.Sc-Thesis-Drug-Encapsulation
This project investigates the encapsulation of Tamoxifen, Chrysin, Salidroside, and 5-Fluorouracil in PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer using molecular dynamics simulations. It evaluates drug-polymer interactions, binding affinity, and encapsulation efficiency, emphasizing the role of lipophilicity in drug delivery systems.
