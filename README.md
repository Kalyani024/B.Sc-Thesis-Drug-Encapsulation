# BSc Thesis: Drug Encapsulation in PLGA-PEG-PLGA Triblock Copolymer

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the development of an efficient drug delivery system using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. It investigates the encapsulation of four drugs—**Tamoxifen**, **Chrysin**, **Salidroside**, and **5-Fluorouracil**—in a **PLGA-PEG-PLGA triblock copolymer**. The study aims to assess the binding affinity, stability, and encapsulation efficiency of each drug within the polymer, with an emphasis on how **lipophilicity** affects drug interactions. The results contribute to the understanding of polymer-drug interactions for enhancing drug delivery systems.

## Objectives
- Investigate the interaction between selected drugs (Tamoxifen, Chrysin, Salidroside, 5-Fluorouracil) and the PLGA-PEG-PLGA copolymer.
- Assess how **lipophilicity** affects **binding affinity** and **encapsulation efficiency**.
- Evaluate the **stability** and **aggregation behavior** of drug-loaded nanoparticles.

## Methodology
1. **Selection of Drugs**: The project selected **Tamoxifen**, **Chrysin**, **Salidroside**, and **5-Fluorouracil** for their pharmacological relevance and distinct chemical properties.
   
2. **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**:
    - **GROMACS** was used to perform MD simulations, which are useful for studying the interactions between drugs and the PLGA-PEG-PLGA polymer.
    - **CHARMM-GUI** was used for setting up the simulations, preparing the polymer and drug molecules for MD analysis.

3. **Data Analysis**:
    - The **binding affinity** of each drug to the copolymer was measured.
    - The **encapsulation efficiency** was evaluated by analyzing the strength of drug binding to the polymer and its stability during the simulation.

## Results
- **Lipophilic Drugs**: Drugs like **Tamoxifen** and **Chrysin**, which are hydrophobic, showed stronger binding to the hydrophobic core of the PLGA polymer, resulting in better encapsulation efficiency.
- **Hydrophilic Drugs**: **Salidroside** and **5-Fluorouracil**, being hydrophilic, exhibited weaker interactions with the polymer core and consequently lower encapsulation efficiency.
- The study demonstrated that **lipophilicity** is a significant factor in the stability and encapsulation efficiency of drug-loaded nanoparticles.
